Home Assingment - README

In a recent assignment, I serialized JSON files to Java objects using the Java library Jackson.

In the metadata.json file I have inserted the required inputs in order to connect to the Vimeo API and also for the text of the expected comment.

The TestCase class is the class where the test cases are located with the assertions to verify the comments were uploaded properly.
